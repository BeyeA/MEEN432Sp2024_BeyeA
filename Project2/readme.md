For Week 1, our group plotted a racetrack consisting of 2 curved sections of radius of 200 meters, 2 straightaway sections of 900 meters, and a track width of 15 meters. Then we plotted a rectangular patch to simulate the vehicle following the center line of the track, rotating as it goes through the curves. 

Instructions: Download the Week1.m (Matlab) file. Open the downloaded file using the Matlab R2023b application. Click the "run" button on the Matlab application. The expected output is a stadium-shaped track with a rectangular patch that follows the track's path.
