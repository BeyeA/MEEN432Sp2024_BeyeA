This file explains how to run the Project 2, Week 2 deliverable.

Part 1: Download the Part1.m (Matlab) file and the Week2.slx (Simulink Block) file. Open the downloaded files using the Matlab R2023b application. Click the "run" button on the Matlab application. The expected output from running the program is set up for 8 simulations as outlined in the Week 2 deliverables. This is so that the computational load of running all 256 simulations is limited at first. 

If all 256 simulations are wanted to be run, the file has commented-out line code that can easily replace the current line code. 

Part 2: Download the Part2.m (Matlab) File, the Option1.slx (Simulink Block) file, the Option2.slx (Simulink Block) file, and the Option3.slx (Simulink Block).  file. Click the "run" button on the Matlab application. The expected output is 36 figures with 3 plots of angular velocity vs. time. The CPU time can be viewed either in the combo table or the CPU_Time_Table.
