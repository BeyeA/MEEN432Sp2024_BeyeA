This file explains how to run the Project 2, Week 2 deliverable.

Part 1: Download the Week2_code_V2.m (Matlab) file and the Week2.slx (Simulink Block) file. Open the downloaded files using the Matlab R2023b application. Click the "run" button on the Matlab application. The expected output from running the program should be 6 figures with two plots per page

Note: For the max simulation error vs. CPU time, for the variable time step, we weren't sure on if the plot needed just a singular value, as we never use the same input variables more than once as in the fixed step time solvers. 

The code is set up to run and display the 8 simulations in the Week 2 deliverable documents. It can run 256 simulations by changing the for loops. 

## Week 3 Feedback (5/5)
Regarding the plots, you do not need to plot the angular velocity/acceleration over time, that was more for Week 1. The way the max error vs cpu time was plotted is good though! Other than that, it looks like Part 1 of the project seems to be complete so good job! Now moving onto Part 2 of the project, the team will need to create different simulink models for the 3 options on how to connect System 2 to System 1. I would suggest copying the model you have now for Part 1 for each of the 3 options and then adding onto it based on what the option is. Once the entire project is complete, make sure to commit Part 1 and Part 2 files with the commit message "Project 1 Final"
