This file explains how to run the Project 2, Week 2 deliverable.

Part 1: Download the Week2_code_V2.m (Matlab) file and the Week2.slx (Simulink Block) file. Open the downloaded files using the Matlab R2023b application. Click the "run" button on the Matlab application. The expected output from running the program should be 6 figures with two plots per page

Note: For the max simulation error vs. CPU time, for the variable time step, we weren't sure on if the plot needed just a singular value, as we never use the same input variables more than once as in the fixed step time solvers. 

The code is set up to run and display the 8 simulations in the Week 2 deliverable documents. It can run 256 simulations by changing the for loops.
