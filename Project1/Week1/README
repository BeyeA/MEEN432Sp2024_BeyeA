This file explains how to run the Project 1, Week 1 deliverable.

Part 1:
Download the Week1_code.m (Matlab) file and the Week1.slx (Simulink Block) file.
Open the downloaded files using the Matlab R2023b application.
Click the "run" button on the Matlab application.
The expected output from running the program should be 6 figures with two plots per page.


## Week 1 Feedback (5/5):
Great job! Keep it up for week 2, you're on the right track! The one thing I want to say is to consider adding some sort of logic (either in MATLAB script or Simulink model) to determine whether the applied torque is constant or sinusoidal as this will change inputs to determine applied torque. 
Also, make sure to use appropriate titles for each plot (i.e. what solver is it, what time step, etc). 
Also, make sure to keep an eye out on writing code like in Line 13/16 without the ; at the end of the line! MATLAB does not seem to like that.
