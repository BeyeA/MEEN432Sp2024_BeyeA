Instructions: Download the P3_model.slx, P3_runsim.m, P3init.m, init_HWY_DriveCycle.m, and init_URB_DriveCycle.m files and place them within the same directory. Open the P3_model.slx Simulink file. Then, open the P3_runsim.m file and click "Run" to run the script. The expected output is two figures, one for the highway drive cycle and the other for the urban drive cycle.  The simulated velocity should be within the 3mph error and at all times. 

For Week 1 and Week 2 of Project 3, we used the demo code to build a longitudinal vehicle model containing a driver model that follows the EPA Urban and Highway drive cycles' desired speed within a +- 3 mph error band. Within the Driver model, our team adjusted the Proportional Gain of the PID controller to 0.5 to stay within the 3mph error band. We then displayed figures for both the Urban and Highway drive cycles that show the desired speed and the simulated speed. We then used the torque and angular velocity from the Simulink model to plot the energy usage in Joules vs time and to calculate the total amount of energy used for each drive cycle. Our team also started working on the electric powertrain model and started setting it up so that it will be able to be integrated within the Powertrain subsystem.
